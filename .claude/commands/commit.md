Commit and Push Changes

Create a conventional commit with all current changes and push to the remote repository.
Steps

    Run git status to see all changes

    Run git diff to review the changes

    Analyze the changes and determine the appropriate conventional commit type:
        feat: for new features
        fix: for bug fixes
        docs: for documentation changes
        style: for formatting changes
        refactor: for code refactoring
        test: for test additions/changes
        chore: for maintenance tasks

    Stage all changes with git add -A

    Create a conventional commit with a descriptive message

    Push to the current branch with git push

Remember: This project follows Conventional Commits specification. Do NOT add co-authors to the commit message.
